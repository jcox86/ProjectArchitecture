# KISS — Keep It Simple

Always start with the **simplest** approach that solves the problem, then evolve only when needed.

## Start simple, avoid over-engineering

- Prefer clear, straightforward code over clever abstractions.
- Do not introduce patterns, layers, or indirection until there is a concrete need.
- Favor readability and maintainability over premature generalization.

```text
# ❌ BAD
- Add multiple abstraction layers and interfaces before there is a second implementation.
- Design for many hypothetical features that may never ship.

# ✅ GOOD
- Implement the straightforward solution first.
- Extract interfaces/abstractions only when you have real duplication or variants.
```

## Break problems into small pieces

- Split complex logic into **small, focused functions** that each do one thing well.
- Keep modules and classes small and cohesive; avoid “god objects” that know/do everything.
- When a function grows large or hard to reason about, break it into simple helpers.

```text
# ❌ BAD
- Single 300-line method that handles validation, mapping, I/O, and error handling.

# ✅ GOOD
- Separate functions for validateInput, mapToModel, saveChangesAsync, and buildResponse.
```

## Simplicity as a default

- When choosing between designs, pick the one with **fewer moving parts** and clearer behavior.
- Prefer explicit, boring solutions over magic or heavy indirection.
- Refactor toward simplicity as features evolve; remove complexity that is no longer needed.
