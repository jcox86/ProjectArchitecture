# Descriptive Naming (Files and Variables)

Use names that clearly convey purpose. Avoid abbreviations, single letters (except idiomatic loop indices), and opaque acronyms unless they are universally known in the codebase.

## Files and folders

- Prefer **kebab-case** or **PascalCase** per project convention; keep casing consistent.
- Name files by **what they are or do**, not by internal implementation detail.
- Keep names short but unambiguous (e.g. `UserProfileService.cs`, `deployment-runbook.md`).

```text
# ❌ BAD
svc.cs, util.ts, xyz-handler.bicep, data1.json

# ✅ GOOD
UserProfileService.cs, formatCurrency.ts, keyVault.bicep, dev.bicepparam
```

## Variables and symbols

- Use **camelCase** or **PascalCase** per language/convention.
- Prefer full words; abbreviate only when the abbreviation is standard (e.g. `id`, `url`, `max`).
- Names should read like natural language in context (e.g. `tenantId`, `maxRetries`, `isEnabled`).

```text
# ❌ BAD
x, tmp, data2, fn(), cfg, tbl

# ✅ GOOD
tenantId, retryCount, formattedDate, getOrderById(), appConfig, ordersTable
```

## Cross-system clarity

- Avoid names that depend on local slang or team-only jargon.
- Prefer names that are self-explanatory in logs, configs, and API contracts.
- When in doubt, choose the name that a new developer or an automated tool could interpret without extra context.
